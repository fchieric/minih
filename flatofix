0: Success/normal termination

ðŸ‘Œbuiltinexe() in bi_handlebi.c: After successful built-in command execution
ðŸ‘Œexecute_external_command() in tokenhandler.c: After successful external command execution
(?)ðŸ‘ŒAfter successful pipe execution in pipes.c

ðŸ‘Œ1: General errors/catchall

ðŸ‘Œbi_pwd_cd.c: When chdir() fails in the ft_cd() function
ðŸ‘Œbi_unset.c: When unset encounters an error
ðŸ‘Œbi_export.c: When export fails or gets invalid arguments
ðŸ‘Œredirs.c: When redirections fail (file not found, permission issues)

2: Misuse of shell builtins or syntax errors

ðŸ‘Œlexer.c: In the validation section that calls is_valid_token_sequence()
ðŸ‘Œlexerquotes.c: When quotes are unclosed or improperly formatted
bi_handlebi.c: When built-ins are called with invalid arguments

126: Command found but not executable

ðŸ‘Œexecute_external_command() in tokenhandler.c: After find_command_path() succeeds but access() with X_OK fails
ðŸ‘Œpipes.c: In the handle_child_process() function when the command is found but can't be executed

ðŸ‘Œ127: Command not found

ðŸ‘Œpipe_executor.c: Already implemented in line 22 when find_command_path() returns NULL
ðŸ‘Œtokenhandler.c: In execute_external_command() after checking path existence

128: Invalid exit argument (exit takes values 0-255)

You need to create an exit built-in function that validates the exit code argument

128+n: Fatal error signal 'n'

signals.c: In the signal handler functions
ctrlc(): Set exit status to 130 for SIGINT
sigquit_handler(): Set exit status to 131 for SIGQUIT
In wait_for_children() when checking WIFSIGNALED(status) to get the signal number

255: Exit status out of range

In your exit built-in command implementation when validating arguments

One important note: You need to check the WIFSIGNALED() macro in places like pipes.c in the wait_for_children() function, and calculate status as 128 + signal number when a process is terminated by a signal.
Example implementation:
cCopyif (WIFSIGNALED(status)) {
    mini->envp->exit_status = 128 + WTERMSIG(status);
} else if (WIFEXITED(status)) {
    mini->envp->exit_status = WEXITSTATUS(status);
}
